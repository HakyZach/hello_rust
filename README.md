# Overview

The software that I have written in this repository is meant to perform a few basic actions like setting up and using variables, reading input from the user and executing a loop.

The purpose for this software was to help me teach myself the programming language "Rust". This is why it is relatively simple and performs a number of small functions rather than one big cohesive one.

# Development Environment

The only development tools I used for this software were Visual Studio Code and Github.

The programming language I used, as was the purpose of this software, was Rust.

# Future Work

There are a few things that I intend to learn in the future thst I was unable to accomplish with this software.

- Item 1: I want to figure out how to use user input as an a data type other than a string

- Item 2: I want to learn how to apply loops in rust in more ways

- Item 3: I want to generally accomplish more with future software.
